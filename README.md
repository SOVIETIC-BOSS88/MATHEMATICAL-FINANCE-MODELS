# MODIFIED-KIRK-S-APPROXIMATION-SIMULATION-TEST-IN-R
THE FOLLOWING CODE IS USED IN A PAPER WHERE WE STUDY RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE APPROXIMATION OF THE SPREAD OPTION PRICING. AS THE KIRK’S APPROXIMATION IS EXTREMELY FLAWED IN THE CASES WHEN THE CORRELATION IS VERY HIGH, WE EXPLORE A RECENT DEVELOPMENT THAT ALLOWS APPROXIMATING WITH SIMPLICITY AND ACCURACY THE OPTION PRICE. TO ASSESS THE GOODNESS OF FIT OF THE NEW METHOD, WE INCREASE DRAMATICALLY THE NUMBER OF SIMULATIONS AND SCENARIOS TO TEST THE NEW METHOD AND COMPARE IT WITH THE ORIGINAL KIRK’S FORMULA. THE SIMULATIONS CONFIRMED THAT THE MODIFIED KIRK’S APPROXIMATION METHOD IS EXTREMELY ACCURATE, IMPROVING KIRK’S APPROACH FOR TWO-ASSET SPREAD OPTIONS.
